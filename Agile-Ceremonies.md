What are the main Agile ceremonies, and what is their purpose?
Daily Stand-ups:
- Daily stand ups are small ~15 minute meetings where team members discuss what they have done since the last meeting, what they plan on doing today and also share any issues/blockers they may have ran into. 


Sprint Planning (Scrum) vs. Continuous Prioritization (Kanban):
-A sprint planning is held at the start of each sprint where the team decides which items to work on from the product backlog and it helps define what will be completed at the end of each sprint; in addition with how it will be done.
- On the other hand, a Continues Prioritization refers to a form of system development where items from the product backlog are constantly reprioritized and worked on based on the working capacity of the team and resources available, without a set time constraint.


Retrospectives:
- A retrospective takes place at the end of each sprint, this is where the team comes together to discuss what went well and what could be improved upon in the previous sprint. The purpose of this is to enhance the quality of the next sprint though continues reflection and feedback feeding into continues learning.


Backlog Refinement:
The backlog refinement, also known as the backlog grooming is to ensure that the backlog is well organised, defined and everything is estimated correctly; ready for future sprints.




How do Agile teams collaborate asynchronously and across time zones?
- The teams can use project tracking softwares such as Trello, that can provide teamembers with updates and keep everyone in the loop in regards to the latest developments.
- Overlaping work hours: teams can find windows of time hwere their work hours overlap to complete tasks such as daily stand up meetings.
- Detailed well written notes: leaving well deatiled notes/updated for teamembers for any progress/issues on the project.
