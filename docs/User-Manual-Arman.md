üîç Research & Learn

What is a ‚ÄúUser Manual for Me‚Äù, and why do teams use them?
- A user manual for me is a guide of how an individual works best, in terms of their prefrences, communication styles and needs overall. It is helpful in reducing friction within the team by allowing other to understand how an individual works/ prefers working and expectations are set accordingly. 

What categories are helpful to include? (e.g., communication style, work habits, feedback preferences)
- Communication stlyes
- Work habbits
- Form of feedback prefrences
- Stress signs and support meathods

How can writing a personal user manual improve teamwork and reduce misunderstandings?
- Personal user manuals for teammembers help reduce miscommunication as expectations and working styles are clearly set within the manual; which helps reduce any unnecessary conflict regarding progress and makes feedback more effective and inclusive.

üìù Reflection

What do you need from teammates to do your best work? (e.g., direct communication, flexibility, detailed instructions, minimal interruptions)
- Direct and open communication from teammates helps me get work done more effectively.

How do you prefer to communicate? (e.g., async messages, video calls, quick check-ins, long discussions)
- I like direct messages, meetings (online or in person), and regular check ins where I can ask for any help if needed.

What helps you stay focused and productive? (e.g., quiet workspace, deep work sessions, structured to-do lists, music)
- A quiet environment, with minimal to no distractions where I can sit and work in peace. The session has a set goal that I need to complete within given timeframes.

How do you like to give and receive feedback? (e.g., clear & direct, with positive reinforcement, written vs. verbal feedback)
- Clear and direct feedback, in person and through emails or texts that tell me that I have done right and what I can improve upon to further enhance my work.

What are some quirks or things to know about your work style? (e.g., need time to process ideas, like to brainstorm out loud, prefer written instructions)
- Written clear instructions, adequate training that ensures I know what to do exactly and I have hyper focus where I study/ do a task for an extented period of time.
