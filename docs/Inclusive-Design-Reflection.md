Read a first-person account from someone with ADHD or Autism about their experiences with productivity tools. (Hint: Look for blog posts, videos, or community discussions.)
- I read a reddit post made by a user with ADHD, they mentioned that tradition productivity tools wernt of much help for them and used strict context switching instead, they created numerious physical enviroments for diffrent taks. Using Library for study, another for projects, and a space dedicated for working out. Like that they were able to train their brain to assosiate dirrent work spaces with their assoiated tasks that helped them stay productive.

- Maybe the addition of a feature that allows them to input what physical space they are in and be able to set an asosiated task with that space, that way the app can block certain activities eg instagram at the library with is assosiated with studying. 

Practice writing a clear, patient, and supportive response to a hypothetical user struggling with executive functioning.

I came across this approch that I feel is really helpfull and keeps me focused throughout the day. Associating certain spaces with a said task and only working on that task at that location can be really useful.
