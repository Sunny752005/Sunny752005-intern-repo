What was your first impression of the app?

- The app seems to be well designed and user-friendly with a easy to navigate user interface with clear labels and instructions that make it easy to understand its purpose and functionality. The app also has a consistent theme of white and brown which matches the focus bear app logo and thus appears visually appealing and professional.

Did you find anything difficult to understand?

- When picking the duration for the task that I had just set up on the focus bear app, the duration was only present in second and did not display the duration in minutes or hours which made it a bit difficult to understand what time duration I was setting up for my task since I had to do the conversion in my head.

If you had to explain Focus Bear to a friend in one sentence, what would you say?

- Focus Bear is a productivity app that helps users manage their time and stay focused on tasks by using a simple and intuitive interface which blocks distracting apps and websites during designated focus sessions and ensures that users stay on track and achieve their goals.

What are some changes that could improve the new user experience?

- When setting up the app, the instructions that appear initially in small boxes and the user has to click the next button to go through all the instructions. This can be improved upon by integrating animative transition in between the screen to make the app more engaging and look more modern.
