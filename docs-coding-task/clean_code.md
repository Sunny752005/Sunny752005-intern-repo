/////Unit Testing & Clean Code Reflection/////

Why Unit Testing Matters

Unit testing is an essential commpponent in software development as it ensures individual pieces of logic (functions, components, slices) work as intended which is done by testing components of the code in isolation for one another; which helps in:

- Catching bugs early before they become a big challenge.
- NMake changes to the code without breaking the app.
- Improve code readability and its modular design.
- Serve as documentation for what the function is supposed to do.


Chosen Testing Framework: Jest

For this project, I used Jest as the unit testing framework since it's:

- Widely used in the React ecosystem.
- Built in support for mocking and asynchronous tests.
- Simple syntax and great developer experience.
