What do you hope to learn from this internship?

- Through this internship I aim to build on the foundational skills and knowledge I have gained during my time at university and apply them in a real world setting to not only get exposure to the industry but also to understnd how the theoretical concepts I have learnt are applied in the really world. I also hope to learn more about app development, how to work in a team setting an gain hands on experience with the software development lifecycle.

What skills are you most excited to develop?

- I am most excited to develop my coding skills, particularly in Go as I have a basic understanding of python and a bit of kotlin but React is a new language for me and I am eager to learn it. I am also excited to develop my problem solving skills and learn how to work effectively and slove real problems/bugs in the app. 

What do you think you can contribute to the team?

- I believe I can contribute a fresh perspective and a strong willingness to learn and adapt. I am a quick learner and work well in a team environment. I am confident that I can bring a positive attitude and work ethic to the Focus Bear team and contribute to the overall success of the projects we work on.

What is one area you feel less confident in that youâ€™d like to improve?

- I area I feel less confident and experienced is in coding with React as I have never worked with it before. I am eager to learn and improve my skills in this area through hands on experience during the internship; but it is still fairly challenging for me at the moment and i need more time to grasp the concepts and syntax.

What does success in this internship look like for you?

- Success in this internship would mean gaining practical experience in app development, improving my coding skills, and contributing to meaningful tasks within the focus bear app. It would also mean building professional relationships and networking with current and upcoming industry professionals. Additionally, success would involve receiving positive feedback from my mentors and team members, and feeling a sense of accomplishment in the work I have completed throughout the internship.
