1. What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?

- What makes focus bear stand out is its ability to combine focus tools with habit-building and lifestyle support rather than just distraction blocking. Where all the other apps such as freedom and cold turkey are centered around blocking websites and/or apps; Focus Bear lifts the user experience by encouraging a more healthy routine alongside working with limited distractions. Apps such as Timo and Routinery are more so about scheduling and routine where FocusBear perfectly balance that along side guiding healthy daily habits.

3. What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?

- Timo and Routinery both have advanced visual and customizable timelines with regular reminders, which makes the routine more engaging overall and enhances user retention.


4. Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?

- The Focus Bear app can significantly improve the UI and integrate more visual elements and animations to make the app more engaging and look sophisticated.
