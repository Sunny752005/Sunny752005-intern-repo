Research Best Debugging Techniques for React

////////What are the most common debugging techniques?////////

1. Console Logging
- This is one of the simplest and fastest ways to check variables, state and props.
- `console.log`, `console.warn`, and `console.error` all of these help and trace the flow and catch issues during the development stage.

2. React DevTools
- Browser extension: Displays -> React component tree.
- Inspect component props, state, context and hooks.
- Helps track, rerender and understand how data flows through the hierarchy in the component.

3. VS Code Debugger
- Allows to set breakpoints and steps through React code within the editor.
- It is good when inspecting complex logic in functions.

4. Error Boundaries
- Uses class components with `componentDidCatch` and `getDerivedStateFromError` to catch and handle runtime errors in the UI.
- Stops the who;e app from crashing by isolating components that have the actual error.


5. Network Tab (DevTools)
- Inspect API calls, request/response payloads, and status codes.
- It is helpfull when debugging Axios or Fetch calls or server related issues present in the code.



////////Which tools are most effective for React debugging?///////

React DevTools -> Inpects the props/state/hooks/components in real time
Browser Console -> Traces logs and error stack trces
VS Code Debugger -> Stepping through logic and useEfect hooks
React Profiler -> Analyzing performance, re-renders and bottlenecks
Error Boundaries -> Handling unexpected runtime crashes



//////////How do you debug issues in large React codebases?///////

1. Component Isolation
- Using Storybook or temporary routes, all the components are rendered into small incremnts.
- Help narrow down to the bugs without it impacting the whole app.

2. Layered Logging
- Add structured logs: "Component Mounted", "API Success", "State Updated".
- By doing this tracing logic across files/components becomes easier.

3. Performance Monitoring
- Use the React Profiler (React DevTools) to track component render frequency and find out if there are any unnessary renders.

4. Avoid Anonymous Inline Functions
- Named functions are easier to trace in stack traces.
- Reduces rerenders caused by unstable inline references.


Summary

Debugging React apps effectively:
- Using the right tool for the job.
- Handling errors properlt and with error boundaries.
- Analyzing performance with the React Profiler.
- Logging clearly and structuring your code for future maintainance/scaling.
