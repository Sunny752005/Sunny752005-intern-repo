////////////Navigation with React Router//////////////

What are the advantages of client-side routing?
- Client-side routining allows for more effieicent and smooth navigation between pages of the app. This is because the browser doesn't have to load the entire page from the server, but only parts of the content update. This enhnaces the user experience with features such as animations and tranistions between the pages whilst also maintainiong the state of the app. 


///////////Working with Lists & User Input////////////

What are some common issues when working with lists in React?
- When working with lists in React, some of the common issues include: not adding a unique key prop when rendering list items. This can lead to performance issues or bugs during the re-renders. Another issue is if the state array is mutated directly instead of creating a new one which prevents React from detechting chnages made. In adition whrn handling user input and the list updates improperly (eg not trimming thr input of duplicates), it can result in unexpected behavioiur in the UI.
