üìå Module 1: Agile Principles & Frameworks

üîç Research & Learn

What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?

- Agile is an itterative approch they is focues around continues deliverly of a shipable product, that helps reduce curomer desatifaction rates as the client is heavly involved in the development process and provided consistent feedback throughout the development process and deciding prioroties. Ensuring the end product needs the clients needs. This differs significantly from traditional PM styles eg waterfall which were linear meaning develoment happened in order and wasn't flexible and thus the odds of the project failure were significantly higher.

What are the core values and principles of Agile? (Hint: Check the Agile Manifesto.)

- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Responding to change over following a plan

What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?

- Scrum: The collaboration is based around sprints which are well defined in terms of the duration (have set time frames), and the teams works together in strucutred ceremonies which involve: Srpint planning, daily standup, scrum review, etc. In scrum the scrum masted ensures the team follows the agile principles and stays productive.

- Kanban: Collobaration takes a more continues approch since there are no fixated time frames. The work flow is tracked through the board and the team collaborates by contantly updatinf the board. Sice Kanban has no fixed ceremonies it makes it more flexibal and teams thus rely on effective communication to coordinate.

- Scrum works best when the team needs strucutre and clear delivery goals within fixed timeframes which boost accountability; and the project has steady prioroties and they do not change significantly overtime. Whereas is used when the project prioroties are subject to change, this works well as the team can still make steady progress despite change in the project requiremnts.

Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?

- Focus Bear leans more towards Kanban because it allows the team to be more flexible, given prioroties can change quickly alongside team size changing (interns coming in and/or finishing their internships) a continues work flow modle like kanban makes it easier to adapt to workflow speed, without being locked in fixated time frames.

üìù Reflection

What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?

- The biggest benifit of agile is the customer involvement during the development stage and its ability to continuesly impove to allign more closely with the customer needs. The key challenge in this approch is maintianing effective communicationw with all team members given the vast number of roles present it can be hard to coordinate tasks well.

How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?

- Agile principle help break down big taks into small managebale chunks which will allow me to deliver value early on and continuesly reslect on my work and improve it. Daily standups will help me stay focused and add accountabiltity ensuring I get work done.

üõ†Ô∏è Task

Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.

- Scrum is more structured and has a fixated timeframe to deliver a working product that has the enhanced features worked on during the sprint. Kanban on the other hand is a more flexible work modle which allows the team to work on task based on thier capacity and the work is tracked using the kanban board.

Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.

- I think the principle of "welcoming changing requirements, even late in development" will be the most useful in my work, as it will help me adapt my work to the chamging needs and ensure that I can repond well to feedback provided which is essential in a fast-working enviroment.
