What are the key roles in an Agile team, and what does each role do?

Developers;
- Are responsible for building the system, their taks involved adding all the product featires required and maintaining code quality. 

QA (Quality Assurance):
- They are responsible for testing the solution for quality and its reliabiluty. They build test plans and automated tests to identify bugs and work with the development team to ensure they are fixed.

Product Manager (PM):
- Defines the end product and the prioroties for the system, alongside managing the product backlog and ensure the end product meets the client requirments.

Agile Project Manager (Agile PM):
- They are responsible for running the agile ceremonies, help the team with any blockers they face and enhance the team productivity whilst uphiolding continues learning. 

Other supporting roles (e.g., stakeholders, UX, customer support):
- UX/UI Designers: Design the UI for a more user-friendly experiences

- Stakeholders: Provide feedback on how the system can be improved


How do these roles collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?

- Scrum: The collaboration is based around sprints which are well defined in terms of the duration (have set time frames), and the teams works together in strucutred ceremonies which involve: Srpint planning, daily standup, scrum review, etc. In scrum the scrum masted ensures the team follows the agile principles and stays productive. 

- Kanban: colaboration takes a more continues approch since there are no fixated time frames. The work flow is tracked through the board and the team collaborates by contantly updatinf the board. Sice Kanban has no fixed ceremonies it makes it more flexibal and teams thus rely on effective communication to coordinate.


üìù Reflection

What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?:
As a frontend development intern my responsibilities will include enhancing the UI for focus bear app and thus deliver high qulity code which in colaoration with the QA and PM ensures that the client needs are meet and the user experience on the app is positive. 

How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?

- QA: to verify that the system work as expected and to fix bugs as they are identified.
- PM: to clarify system requirements and priorities.
- UX: to ensure designs implemented are accurate for the focus bear app.

üõ†Ô∏è Task

Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.

- As a Frontend Developer Intern at Focus Bear, my responsibilities incluedes turning the UI designs into real features for the app, ensuring they work as intended, are accessible and ensure that they allign wiht the requirments outlines. Ensuring that the user experience on the app remains positive and that the app layout and design is easy to grasp.

Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.

- One key role I will constantly collborate with dueing my internship are QA engineers. In order to improve teamwork with them I will ensure to involve them early in the development stage and maintain clear communication in terms of the test cases which will help by reducing misunderstandings regarding expectations and minimise bugs in the developed feature.



####Past Experience###
- Although I haven't worked directly with a QA or PM, during my time at the MIG program at monash, where my team developed a prototype for an AI chatbot, I was tasked with refining the user flow and enhancing the conversational interfacr. During a sprint there was some confusion in regards to how the chatbot should behave to fall back scenarios. To address this challenge my team and I did a zoom call where we mapped out the conversation branches together using miro. This allowed us to align the chatbot logic with user experience. Highlighting how proactive communication and visual planning tools like miro can help syncernise agile teams and enhance the end product.

####My colab plan for focus bear team:
- To stay aligned with the team, I will use Discord for quick messaging and check-ins, Zoom for the daily stand-up meetings and asking for help if I am stuck, and GitHub repo to track progress and update task statuses.
