What are the risks of using a laptop without an external monitor or keyboard?

- Using a laptop without a proper monitor or external keyboard can significantly effect the posture, leading to a hunched back and significant eye strain due to a smaller screen. Which can cause lower back pain and eye problems in the long run.

What ergonomic equipment can improve posture when working on a laptop? (e.g., laptop stands, external keyboards, ergonomic chairs)

- Laptop stand to move it to eye level.
- Ergonomic chair that suppoerts the lower back and improves posture.
- Adjustable desk.

What adjustments should be made to monitor height, chair position, and desk setup for a healthier workspace?

- Top of the screen should be at the eye level.
- Chair lowered/higher to ensure feet are flat on the ground comfortably.
- Desk sould be set up to ensure wrist stays straight while typing.

What are some daily habits that reduce the impact of prolonged laptop use? (e.g., movement breaks, posture checks, eye strain reduction techniques)

- Short breaks after every hour of half.
- Regular posture checks
- Meditating sessions (eyes closed for some time to reduce strain)

üìù Reflection

What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup? (e.g., using an external monitor, adjusting your chair, using a laptop stand)

- I can start using external monitor, laptop stand and mouse to reduce neck, wrist and eye strain. If posible also get an adjustable chair to adjsut the height of the chair to ensure my feet are flat on the ground.

What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain? (e.g., sitting upright, taking regular breaks, adjusting screen height)

- Focus on sitting upright, takign regular breaks for streaching and getting a monitor to reduce eye strain.

How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day? (Hint: Use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks!)

- Use Focus bear for frequent movements breaks!

üõ†Ô∏è Task

Adjust your laptop setup based on ergonomic best practices.

- I started using an external mouse to reduce wrist strain and use an adjustable chair to raise it to a good height and which supports my lower back.

Identify at least one piece of equipment that could improve your posture and comfort.

- A chair that has lumber support and improves my posture, reducing the strain on my lower back.

Try using posture and movement reminders for a full workday and note any improvements. (Hint: Focus Bear has built-in reminders for movement breaks!)

Document at least one workspace change or habit adjustment you made.

- I started using an external mouse to reduce wrist strain and use an adjustable chair to raise it to a good height and which supports my lower back.

- Personal improvement: After having used the timers for breaks in between work, the real change I norticed was lower back pain as I was able to streach it out and decompress my spine. Second big diffrence is the lower eye strain I experence.
