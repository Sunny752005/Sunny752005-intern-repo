üîç Research & Learn

- I am a cyber security major and am aware of all/most of these and thus no research is required.

- I have completed the following Cyber security unit:

- Introduction to Cyber security (Monash)
- Cyber tools and techniques (Monash)

üìù Reflection

What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?

- I currently follow numerious security measures online including:
- Using a VPN
- Avoiding Public wifi for sensitive tasks (banking)
- Multi factor authentication
- Using stong and alternative passwords for all services

- One improvements could be: Consistently auditing 3rd party app data usage.

How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?

- By treating these cyber security protocols as part of my work flow rather than a separate set of tasks that I need to ensure to complete. That way it limits the chances of them being overlooked.

What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?

- Maintain a password manager and use stong passwords in terms of length, chanracter use and predictability
- Rotate passwords consistently
- Avoid password reuse for 1 or more service

What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?

- Immediatly follow steps to secure my data, change the paswords for my account and report the incident to the right individual responsible (manager, cyber security personal) and lastly review my oassword manager for same password for any other serve and change it is present.

üõ†Ô∏è Task

Ensure your work accounts have strong passwords and enable 2FA where possible.

- Yes i do!

Review your password storage method‚Äîif you‚Äôre not using a password manager, consider setting one up.

- Have a password manager setup with all my passwords

Set up your computer and phone to automatically lock (require a password or biometric login) if you are away for more than a few minutes

- I will always ensure I lock my devices when I am going away

Document one new cyber security habit you will follow at Focus Bear.

- I will perform a regular review of third party app acess to my accounts and remove any unnesesay or suspicial apps to ensure data security.
