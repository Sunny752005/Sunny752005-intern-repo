Agile Workflows & Kanban

üîç Research & Learn

How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?
- The Kanban board helps visualise the tasks as they move through diffrent stages of clomplition, which helps the team identify potential bottlenecks and helps the team manage the workflow in a more steady manner. It helps avoid issues related to starting too many tasks at once which can lead to numerious tasks being left uncompleted or alleast not to a high satndard in terms of quality. 

What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent? (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Done)
- Backlog: Items/Tasks that have not yet been started. 
- To: The work that is to be completed/ ready to be started.
- In progress: Tasks that are being worked on. 
- Blocked: Task that have faced an issue and can not be continued. 
- Done: Completed tasks. 

How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?
- Teammembers put tasks in progress when they start working on them. 
- When the task progresses to the next stage it is updated.
- Overall the individual/team member working on a certain task is responsible for updating the task on the board. 

What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?
- Encourages completion: team members finish current tasks before starting a new one. 
- Reduces mutitasking, thus enhancing the quality of the output.
- Helps maintain a consistent flow of work, and thus the predictability of completion.
